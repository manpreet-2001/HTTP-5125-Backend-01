This repository contains Back-End-Web-Development-1---HTTP-5125.

In this course, I learned server-side web development using C#. I explored how to create data-driven websites and gained hands-on experience in pulling data from various external sources. My skills in building robust web applications with ASP.NET have been further developed, enhancing my ability to create dynamic and interactive websites.
